# Contact Book

## Welcome to my Address Book

It has the following features:

- Add entry
- Display entries
- Search entries ("back" is not fully working as expected.)
- Error checking for age (must input number)
- Checks if the file "contacts.csv" exists. If not, it creates it with the columns defined in "header" variable
- It will also clean up a dirty "contacts.csv" if the columns are incorrect
